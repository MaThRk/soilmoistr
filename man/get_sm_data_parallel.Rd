\title{Function to extract the soilmoisture data for a set of landslides with a given date}
\usage{
get_sm_data_parallel(
  landsld = NULL,
  path_sm = "\\\\\\\\projectdata.eurac.edu/projects/Proslide/soilmoisture/32632",
  days_before_window = 5,
  days_after_window = 0,
  point_buffer = NULL,
  aggre_fun = NULL
)
}
\description{
This funtions takes a path to the folder of all the soilmoisture-tiffs and a geometry.
The geometry must have a column called \code{date}. This is necessasry in order to check if there is
soilmoisture data for the date of the landslide (plus, minus \code{days_before_window, days_after_window}).
It then extracts the soilmoisture values for the point, the buffered point, ot the polygon.
